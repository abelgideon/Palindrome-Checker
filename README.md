# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple Palindrome Checker application created as part of a freeCodeCamp course on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. The application checks if a given word or sentence is a palindrome.

## Features

- **User Input**: The application allows users to input a word or sentence.
- **Palindrome Check**: It determines whether the input is a palindrome, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for a better user experience.
